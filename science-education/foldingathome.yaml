  description: '[Folding@home] is a distributed computing project for simulating protein
    dynamics, including the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins
    implicated in a variety of diseases. It brings together citizen scientists who
    volunteer to run simulations of protein dynamics on their personal computers.
    Insights from this data are helping scientists to better understand biology, and
    providing new opportunities for developing therapeutics.'
