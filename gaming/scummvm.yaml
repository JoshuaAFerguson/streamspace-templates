  description: '[ScummVM] is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical
    adventure and role-playing games, provided you already have their data files.
    The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with
    the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed!
    ScummVM is a complete rewrite of these games'' executables and is not an emulator.'
